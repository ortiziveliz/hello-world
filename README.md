Hi everyone!

My name is Ivy. I am a recent graduate of Florida State University where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. I realized my interest in coding languages and decided to teach myself how to program. I hope to work up towards being a software engineer one day. 

Sounds like it will be difficult but I will be working hard every step of the way!
